# LED Lighting

## BOM

* LED Strips
  Multiple options available depending on what you want.  Depending on the voltage you choose, might need a buck converter or 12v PSU.  If going RGB, use something like the [Klipper Expander](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Hardware/tree/master/Klipper_Expander) which has a level shifted neopixel header.
  [24v White](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073QNMS5J)
  [5v UV](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0811HJ65Q)
  [5v RGB](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BTTY4FL)

* LED Corner Channel
  Should be 16mm x 16mm, which is a pretty standard size.  You'll need at most ~400mm per side.  Cut to length.
  [Silver, 6 meters](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06Y2Z8PST) - This is what I bought, wasn't thinking and should have gone black.
  [Black, 5 meters](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DM7GBIM/)

* Printed cable clip, just print a bunch - [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2424166)
* Printed LED channel mount
  [Voron User Mods](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/legacy_printers/printer_mods/Armstr0ng)
  Print one left, one right for each LED channel that you are mounting.
